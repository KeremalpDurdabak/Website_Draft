# Website Draft

This repository contains a basic multi-page website template. Pages include:

- `index.html` – landing page with a simple image carousel.
- `products.html` – placeholder product list.
- `about.html` – company background page.
- `contact.html` – contact form.

Static assets (CSS, JavaScript and placeholder images) are stored in the `assets` directory.

## Customization


1. The pages use placeholder images from [Picsum](https://picsum.photos).
   Replace the `src` attributes on any `<img>` elements with your own URLs or
   local files when you're ready.

2. Carousel slides are defined in `assets/js/slide-data.js`.
   Edit this file to add or remove slides with accompanying text.

3. Update the company name and text content in each HTML file to suit your needs.
4. Swap the header logo by replacing the text `<h1>YUSUF NAKLIYAT</h1>` with an `<img>` element pointing to your logo.

5. Product listings and details are generated from `assets/js/product-data.js`.
   Add new products by editing that file; each entry will automatically appear
   on the products page and have its own detail view.
