# Website Draft

This repository contains a basic multi-page website template. Pages include:

- `index.html` – landing page with a simple image carousel.
- `products.html` – placeholder product list.
- `about.html` – company background page.
- `contact.html` – contact form.

Static assets (CSS, JavaScript and placeholder images) are stored in the `assets` directory.

## Customization

1. The carousel uses remote placeholder images from `via.placeholder.com`.
   Update the `<img>` `src` attributes in `index.html` with your own image URLs
   or local files.
2. Update the company name and text content in each HTML file to suit your needs.
3. Swap the header logo by replacing the text `<h1>Ammo Corp</h1>` with an `<img>` element pointing to your logo.

No build process is required; simply open the HTML files in a browser to view the site.
